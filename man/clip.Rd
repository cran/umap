\title{Force (clip) a value into a finite range}
\usage{
clip(x, xmax = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric; single value or a vector}

\item{xmax}{maximum value for x}
}
\value{
numeric values in range [-xmax, xmax]
}
\description{
This R implementation can be made slightly faster by hard-coding
the xmax value inside the function. However, performance is
even better with Rcpp. This implementation exists mainly to
facilitate testing the Rcpp version.
